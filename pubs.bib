 abstract = {Segmenting anatomical structures from medical images is usually one of the most important initial steps in many applications, including visualization, computer-aided diagnosis, and morphometric analysis. Manual 2D segmentation suffers from operator variability and is tedious and time-consuming. These disadvantages are accentuated in 3D applications and, the additional requirement of producing intuitive displays to integrate 3D information for the user, makes manual segmentation even less approachable in 3D. Robust, automatic medical image segmentation in 2D to 3D remains an open problem caused particularly by sensitivity to low-level parameters of segmentation algorithms. Semi-automatic techniques present possible balanced solution where automation focuses on low-level computing-intensive tasks that can be hidden from the user, while manual intervention captures high-level expert knowledge nontrivial to capture algorithmically. In this paper we present a 3D extension to the 2D semi-automatic live-wire technique. Live-wire based contours generated semi-automatically on a selected set of slices are used as seed points on new unseen slices in different orientations. The seed points are calculated from intersections of user-based live-wire techniques with new slices. Our algorithm includes a step for ordering the live-wire seed points in the new slices, which is essential for subsequent multi-stage optimal path calculation. We present results of automatically detecting contours in new slices in 3D volumes from a variety of medical images.},

Multiple cost terms were analyzed for their inclusion in the final total cost function including color gradient magnitude, color gradient direction, Canny edge detection, and Laplacian zero crossing. The gradient magnitude and direction cost terms were implemented so that they acted directly on the three components of the color image, instead of using a single derived color band.

 abstract = {Genomic islands (GIs), including pathogenicity islands, are commonly defined as clusters of genes in prokaryotic genomes that have probable horizontal origins. These genetic elements have been associated with rapid adaptations in prokaryotes that are of medical, economical or environmental importance, such as pathogen virulence, antibiotic resistance, symbiotic interactions, and notable secondary metabolic capabilities. As the number of genomic sequences increases, the impact of GIs in prokaryotic evolution has become more apparent and detecting these regions using bioinformatics approaches has become an integral part of studying microbial evolution and function. In this dissertation, I describe a novel comparative genomics approach for identifying GIs, called IslandPick, and the application of this method to construct robust datasets that were used to test the accuracy of several previously published GI prediction programs. In addition, I will discuss the features of a new GI web resource, called IslandViewer, which integrates the most accurate GI predictors currently available. Further, the role of several GI and prophage regions and their involvement in virulence in an epidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain that infects cystic fibrosis patients will be described; as well as an observation that recently discovered phage defence elements, CRISPRs, are over-represented within GIs.},

Current data standards do not capture the full scope of FCM experiments and there is a demand for software tools that can assist in the exploration and analysis of large FCM datasets. We are implementing a standardized approach to capturing, analyzing, and disseminating FCM data that will facilitate both more complex analyses and analysis of datasets that could not previously be efficiently studied. Initial work has focused on developing a community-based guideline for recording and reporting the details of FCM experiments. Open source software tools that implement this standard are being created, with an emphasis on facilitating reproducible and extensible data analyses. As well, tools for electronic collaboration will assist the integrated access and comprehension of experiments to empower users to collaborate on FCM analyses. This coordinated, joint development of bioinformatics standards and software tools for FCM data analysis has the potential to greatly facilitate both basic and clinical research--impacting a notably diverse range of medical and environmental research areas.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genomic islands (GIs) are clusters of genes in prokaryotic genomes of probable horizontal origin. GIs are disproportionately associated with microbial adaptations of medical or environmental interest. Recently, multiple programs for automated detection of GIs have been developed that utilize sequence composition characteristics, such as G+C ratio and dinucleotide bias. To robustly evaluate the accuracy of such methods, we propose that a dataset of GIs be constructed using criteria that are independent of sequence composition-based analysis approaches. RESULTS: We developed a comparative genomics approach (IslandPick) that identifies both very probable islands and non-island regions. The approach involves 1) flexible, automated selection of comparative genomes for each query genome, using a distance function that picks appropriate genomes for identification of GIs, 2) identification of regions unique to the query genome, compared with the chosen genomes (positive dataset) and 3) identification of regions conserved across all genomes (negative dataset). Using our constructed datasets, we investigated the accuracy of several sequence composition-based GI prediction tools. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that AlienHunter has the highest recall, but the lowest measured precision, while SIGI-HMM is the most precise method. SIGI-HMM and IslandPath/DIMOB have comparable overall highest accuracy. Our comparative genomics approach, IslandPick, was the most accurate, compared with a curated list of GIs, indicating that we have constructed suitable datasets. This represents the first evaluation, using diverse and, independent datasets that were not artificially constructed, of the accuracy of several sequence composition-based GI predictors. The caveats associated with this analysis and proposals for optimal island prediction are discussed.},

 abstract = {The direct "metagenomic" sequencing of genomic material from complex assemblages of bacteria, archaea, viruses and microeukaryotes has yielded new insights into the structure of microbial communities. For example, analysis of metagenomic data has revealed the existence of previously unknown microbial taxa whose spatial distributions are limited by environmental conditions, ecological competition, and dispersal mechanisms. However, differences in genotypes that might lead biologists to designate two microbes as taxonomically distinct need not necessarily imply differences in ecological function. Hence, there is a growing need for large-scale analysis of the distribution of microbial function across habitats. Here, we present a framework for investigating the biogeography of microbial function by analyzing the distribution of protein families inferred from environmental sequence data across a global collection of sites. We map over 6,000,000 protein sequences from unassembled reads from the Global Ocean Survey dataset to [Formula: see text] protein families, generating a protein family relative abundance matrix that describes the distribution of each protein family across sites. We then use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to approximate these protein family profiles as linear combinations of a small number of ecological components. Each component has a characteristic functional profile and site profile. Our approach identifies common functional signatures within several of the components. We use our method as a filter to estimate functional distance between sites, and find that an NMF-filtered measure of functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than a comparable PCA-filtered measure. We also find that functional distance is more strongly correlated with environmental distance than with geographic distance, in agreement with prior studies. We identify similar protein functions in several components and suggest that functional co-occurrence across metagenomic samples could lead to future methods for de-novo functional prediction. We conclude by discussing how NMF, and other dimension reduction methods, can help enable a macroscopic functional description of marine ecosystems.},

 abstract = {A central challenge in microbial community ecology is the delineation of appropriate units of biodiversity, which can be taxonomic, phylogenetic or functional in nature. The term "community" is applied ambiguously; in some cases the term refers simply to a set of observed entities, while in other cases it requires that these entities interact with one another. Microbes can rapidly gain and lose genes, potentially decoupling community roles from taxonomic and phylogenetic groupings. Trait-based approaches offer a useful alternative, but many traits can be defined based on gene functions, metabolic modules, and genomic properties, and the optimal set of traits to choose is often not obvious. An analysis that considers taxon assignment and traits in concert may be ideal, with the strengths of each approach offsetting the weaknesses of the other. Individual genes also merit consideration as entities in an ecological analysis, with characteristics such as diversity, turnover, and interactions modeled using genes rather than organisms as entities. We identify some promising avenues of research that are likely to yield a deeper understanding of microbial communities that shift from observation-based questions of "Who is There?" and "What Are They Doing?" to the mechanistically driven "How Will They Respond?"

Many computational tools exist for the prediction of GIs, but three of the most accurate methods are available in integrated form via IslandViewer: IslandPath-DIMOB, SIGI-HMM and IslandPick. IslandViewer GI predictions are precomputed for all complete microbial genomes from National Center for Biotechnology Information, with an option to upload other genomes and/or perform customized analyses using different settings. Here, we report recent changes to the IslandViewer framework that have vastly improved its efficiency in handling an increasing number of users, plus better facilitate custom genome analyses. Users may also now overlay additional annotations such as virulence factors, antibiotic resistance genes and pathogen-associated genes on top of current GI predictions. Comparisons of GIs between user-selected genomes are now facilitated through a highly requested side-by-side viewer. IslandViewer improvements aim to provide a more flexible interface, coupled with additional highly relevant annotation information, to aid analysis of GIs in diverse microbial species.},

 abstract = {SUMMARY: Genomic islands (clusters of genes of probable horizontal origin; GIs) play a critical role in medically important adaptations of bacteria. Recently, several computational methods have been developed to predict GIs that utilize either sequence composition bias or comparative genomics approaches. IslandViewer is a web accessible application that provides the first user-friendly interface for obtaining precomputed GI predictions, or predictions from user-inputted sequence, using the most accurate methods for genomic island prediction: IslandPick, IslandPath-DIMOB and SIGI-HMM. The graphical interface allows easy viewing and downloading of island data in multiple formats, at both the chromosome and gene level, for method-specific, or overlapping, GI predictions. AVAILABILITY: The IslandViewer web service is available at http://www.pathogenomics.sfu.ca/islandviewer and the source code is freely available under the GNU GPL license.},

 abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates have a highly conserved core genome representing up to 90% of the total genomic sequence with additional variable accessory genes, many of which are found in genomic islands or islets. The identification of the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) in a children's cystic fibrosis (CF) unit in 1996 and its subsequent observation in several centers in the United Kingdom challenged the previous widespread assumption that CF patients acquire only unique strains of P. aeruginosa from the environment. To learn about the forces that shaped the development of this important epidemic strain, the genome of the earliest archived LES isolate, LESB58, was sequenced. The sequence revealed the presence of many large genomic islands, including five prophage clusters, one defective (pyocin) prophage cluster, and five non-phage islands. To determine the role of these clusters, an unbiased signature tagged mutagenesis study was performed, followed by selection in the chronic rat lung infection model. Forty-seven mutants were identified by sequencing, including mutants in several genes known to be involved in Pseudomonas infection. Furthermore, genes from four prophage clusters and one genomic island were identified and in direct competition studies with the parent isolate; four were demonstrated to strongly impact on competitiveness in the chronic rat lung infection model. This strongly indicates that enhanced in vivo competitiveness is a major driver for maintenance and diversifying selection of these genomic prophage genes.},

 abstract = {Genes arising by retrotransposition are always different from their parent genes from the outset. In addition, the cDNA must insert into a region that allows expression or it will become a processed pseudogene. We sought to determine whether this class of gene duplication differs from other gene duplications based on functional criteria. Using amino acid sequences from Drosophila melanogaster, we identified retroduplicated gene pairs at various levels of sequence identity. Analysis of gene ontology annotations showed some enrichment of retroduplications in the cellular physiological processes class. Retroduplications show a higher level of nucleotide substitution than other gene duplications, suggesting a higher rate of divergence. Remarkably, analysis of microarray data for gene expression during embryogenesis showed that parent genes are more highly expressed relative to their retroduplicated copies, tandem duplications, and all genes. Furthermore, an expressed sequence tag library representation shows a broader distribution for parent genes than for all other genes and, as found previously by others, retroduplicated gene transcripts are found most abundantly in testes. Therefore, in examining retroduplicated gene pairs, we have found that parent genes of retroduplications are also a distinctive class in terms of transcript expression levels and distribution.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND:New computational resources are needed to manage the increasing volume of biological data from genome sequencing projects. One fundamental challenge is the ability to maintain a complete and current catalog of protein diversity. We developed a new approach for the identification of protein families that focuses on the rapid discovery of homologous protein sequences.RESULTS:We implemented fully automated and high-throughput procedures to de novo cluster proteins into families based upon global alignment similarity. Our approach employs an iterative clustering strategy in which homologs of known families are sifted out of the search for new families. The resulting reduction in computational complexity enables us to rapidly identify novel protein families found in new genomes and to perform efficient, automated updates that keep pace with genome sequencing. We refer to protein families identified through this approach as "Sifting Families," or SFams. Our analysis of ~10.5 million protein sequences from 2,928 genomes identified 436,360 SFams, many of which are not represented in other protein family databases. We validated the quality of SFam clustering through statistical as well as network topology--based analyses.CONCLUSIONS:We describe the rapid identification of SFams and demonstrate how they can be used to annotate genomes and metagenomes. The SFam database catalogs protein-family quality metrics, multiple sequence alignments, hidden Markov models, and phylogenetic trees. Our source code and database are publicly available and will be subject to frequent updates (http://edhar.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/sifting_families/).},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been noted that many bacterial virulence factor genes are located within genomic islands (GIs; clusters of genes in a prokaryotic genome of probable horizontal origin). However, such studies have been limited to single genera or isolated observations. We have performed the first large-scale analysis of multiple diverse pathogens to examine this association. We additionally identified genes found predominantly in pathogens, but not non-pathogens, across multiple genera using 631 complete bacterial genomes, and we identified common trends in virulence for genes in GIs. Furthermore, we examined the relationship between GIs and clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) proposed to confer resistance to phage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show quantitatively that GIs disproportionately contain more virulence factors than the rest of a given genome (p<1E-40 using three GI datasets) and that CRISPRs are also over-represented in GIs. Virulence factors in GIs and pathogen-associated virulence factors are enriched for proteins having more "offensive" functions, e.g. active invasion of the host, and are disproportionately components of type III/IV secretion systems or toxins. Numerous hypothetical pathogen-associated genes were identified, meriting further study. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first systematic analysis across diverse genera indicating that virulence factors are disproportionately associated with GIs. "Offensive" virulence factors, as opposed to host-interaction factors, may more often be a recently acquired trait (on an evolutionary time scale detected by GI analysis). Newly identified pathogen-associated genes warrant further study. We discuss the implications of these results, which cement the significant role of GIs in the evolution of many pathogens.},
