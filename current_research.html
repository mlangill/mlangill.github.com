    <h3>Human Microbiome</h3>
    <p class="meta">My labs focus is to better understand huyman-microbial interactions and how that can be used to improve human health in various ways. This includes improving our understanding of drug metabolism by the gut microbiome that leads to better efficacy and less toxicity. Learning how our human microbiome varies with age, diet, and exercise; and identifying links between our individual genome and the type of bacterial comminity we contain.</p>
